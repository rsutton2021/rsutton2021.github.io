# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio site to showcase my skills and development as I work my way towards becoming a full stack engineer. 

## Technologies
The languages used for this project are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Comments
This site has been a learning process and there are some aspects that I now wish I had done differently. It is still work in progress and will be subject to some tweaking as I improve my CSS and JavaScript expertise.
